# Brain Tumor Detection

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Brain Tumor Detection System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. It supports **both CT scan and MRI scan** images to predict whether a brain tumor is present or not. The model is trained using **deep learning** techniques and integrated into a **Flask web application** for user-friendly predictions.

## 🏗️ Features

- **Supports both CT and MRI scans** for tumor prediction.
- **Pre-trained CNN model** for accurate classification.
- **Flask-based web app** with an interactive frontend.
- **Drag-and-drop functionality** for easy image upload.

## 🧪 Model Training

The CNN model was trained using TensorFlow/Keras on a dataset of brain scan images. It was trained using the VGG16 model, achieving an impressive 97.4% accuracy in tumor classification on the following dataset -

The model utilizes feature extraction and classification layers to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cases.
